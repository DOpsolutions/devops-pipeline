# DevOps Pipeline for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

This repository contains a basic **DevOps pipeline** for automating the build, test, deployment, and monitoring processes of a simple web application or microservice using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Slack** for notifications. The pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` and automates the following stages:

1. **Checkout** - Pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build** - Builds the Docker image for the application.
3. **Test** - Runs unit tests inside the Docker container.
4. **Static Code Analysis** - Runs static analysis with SonarQube for code quality and vulnerability checks.
5. **Push to Docker Registry** - Pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
6. **Deploy to Kubernetes** - Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.
7. **Monitor** - Monitors the application's health in Kubernetes.
8. **Notify** - Sends Slack notifications about the pipeline's success or failure.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this pipeline, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

1. **Jenkins**:
   - Jenkins should be installed and running.
   - The **Jenkins Slack Plugin** must be installed for Slack notifications.
   - Jenkins must have access to Docker and Kubernetes.

2. **Docker**:
   - Docker should be installed on the Jenkins agents to build and push Docker images.

3. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - You need a Kubernetes cluster to deploy the application. Ensure you have `kubectl` access to your cluster.

4. **GitHub Repository**:
   - The source code should be hosted in a GitHub repository (or another Git-based system).
   - The pipeline is set to trigger on changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

5. **Slack Webhook**:
   - Set up a Slack Webhook URL and create a Slack channel for notifications. This can be done by configuring the Slack plugin in Jenkins.

## Pipeline Overview

### Stages in the Jenkinsfile:

1. **Checkout**:
   - The pipeline checks out the latest code from the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   - The application is containerized into a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` present in the repository.
   - The image is tagged with the Jenkins build number for versioning.

3. **Run Unit Tests**:
   - The unit tests are executed inside the newly built Docker container to verify code correctness.

4. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - The pipeline runs **SonarQube** (or another static analysis tool) to check the code for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability.

5. **Push Docker Image**:
   - If all tests and checks pass, the Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

6. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - The Docker image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`. The `Deployment` is updated with the new image.

7. **Monitor**:
   - The pipeline monitors the health of the deployed application by querying the Kubernetes cluster for pod status.

8. **Notify**:
   - Once the pipeline completes, a notification is sent to Slack with the status of the build (success or failure).

## Setting Up the Pipeline

### Jenkins Setup

1. **Install Jenkins**: 
   - If you don't have Jenkins installed, follow the instructions on the [Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to install it.
   
2. **Install Required Plugins**:
   - Install the following Jenkins plugins:
     - **Docker Plugin**: To interact with Docker and build images.
     - **Kubernetes Plugin**: To deploy and interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
     - **Slack Notification Plugin**: To send notifications to Slack.
   
3. **Set Up Credentials**:
   - Configure Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub (for pushing images) and Slack (for notifications).
   - Store the **DockerHub username/password** and **Slack Webhook URL** as Jenkins credentials.

4. **Create Jenkins Job**:
   - Create a new **Pipeline Job** in Jenkins.
   - In the pipeline configuration, point to the `Jenkinsfile` in your GitHub repository or repository URL.

### Docker Setup

1. **Dockerfile**:
   - Ensure the repository contains a valid `Dockerfile` that defines how to build the application container.
   
2. **Docker Registry**:
   - Set up a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitLab Container Registry) to store the built images.
   - Ensure Jenkins has permissions to push Docker images to your registry.

### Kubernetes Setup

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running, either locally (via Minikube) or on a cloud provider (AWS EKS, Google GKE, etc.).
   
2. **Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - Ensure that Jenkins has access to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` configuration.

3. **Deployment in Kubernetes**:
   - Make sure that your application is already deployed in Kubernetes and that the deployment is defined in a Kubernetes `Deployment` resource.
   - Update the `deployment/myapp-deployment` with the correct name and namespace if necessary.

### Slack Notifications

1. **Create a Slack Channel**:
   - Create a Slack channel to receive build notifications (e.g., `#devops-notifications`).

2. **Configure Slack Plugin in Jenkins**:
   - Go to **Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.
   - Set up the Slack plugin with your **Slack Webhook URL**.

---

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   - When changes are pushed to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline.

2. **Monitor Pipeline Execution**:
   - You can watch the progress of the pipeline in the Jenkins dashboard, which will show logs for each stage.

3. **View Results in Slack**:
   - Once the pipeline finishes, you will receive a notification in the Slack channel indicating whether the build was successful or failed.

---

## Monitoring and Notifications

- The pipeline includes basic health checks in the **Monitor** stage to ensure the application is running in Kubernetes after deployment.
- In addition to this, you can extend monitoring by integrating **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for more detailed performance metrics and logs.
  
**Slack Notifications**:
- The pipeline sends a success or failure notification to the designated Slack channel, helping the team stay informed about the pipeline status in real-time.

---

## Extending the Pipeline

You can further extend this pipeline to support more advanced use cases:

1. **Integration Tests**: 
   - Add a stage for running integration tests after the **Build** stage to ensure that the application interacts correctly with other services or databases.

2. **Canary or Blue/Green Deployment**:
   - Implement **Blue/Green** or **Canary** deployment strategies in the **Deploy to Kubernetes** stage to minimize downtime and reduce deployment risk.

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Use tools like **Trivy** or **Clair** to scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities before pushing them to the Docker registry.

4. **Staging Environment**:
   - Add an additional **Staging** deployment step before pushing to **Production**, so you can validate the application in a controlled environment before production deployment.

## Conclusion

This pipeline provides a simple and automated approach to **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** for web applications or microservices. By integrating tools like **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Slack**, you can automate code building, testing, deployment, and monitoring while ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
